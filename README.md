Description of VLSI project

This is a University project (2020). 

The task was to implement the Score 4 game on a FPGA, that inputs would be given from keyboard and outputs would be displayed on a VGA. The first labs were completed succefully, but due to Covid-19, the task was completed through an online VGA simulator. 

The design is described in SystemVerilog and the tools we used are Quartus II, ModelSim and online VGA simulator. Also, during the first labs, we had the chance to work on a FPGA and a VGA.
